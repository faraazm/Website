        >Java was the first programming language I ever coded in which was around my senior year of high school around 2014. When I saw ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù print out in the console for the very first time, I knew Computer Science was the career choice for me. In college, I spent countless days completing courses on Udemy to learn about Full Stack Development. Eventually, I was able to land a few clients and created websites for commission. I graduated from CUNY Queens College with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Computer Science in December 2019.</p>
